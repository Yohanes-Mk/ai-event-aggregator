# Project Status Log

Updates are appended at the bottom. Nothing is deleted — this is a running log.

> **Convention:** Update this file after every work session.
> Add what we built, what works, what doesn't, any errors hit, what's next.
> Never delete earlier entries — append new sections at the bottom.
> If something is replaced, removed, or no longer relevant, note that in the new entry (e.g. "replaced X with Y", "X removed — no longer needed") rather than erasing the old entry.

### What's been built

**`app/scrapers/youtube/scraper.py`**
- `Channel(BaseModel)` — Pydantic model: `channel_id`, `name`
- `Video(BaseModel)` — Pydantic model: `video_id`, `title`, `url` (HttpUrl), `published_at`, `channel_name`, `channel_id`, `transcript | None`
- `YouTubeScraper` class — instantiated with `channel_id` + `channel_name`
  - `fetch_latest_videos(within_days=7)` — pulls from YouTube RSS feed, filters by age, returns `list[Video]`
  - `fetch_latest_video()` — returns the single most recent video regardless of age
  - `fetch_transcript(video)` — attaches transcript text via `youtube-transcript-api`, returns new `Video` via `model_copy`
  - `scrape(within_days=14, with_transcripts=True)` — full pipeline

**`app/scrapers/youtube/channels.py`**
- `CHANNELS` — list of 8 pre-configured channels (Fireship, Theo, Karpathy, AI Explained, Diary of a CEO, Lex Fridman, My First Million, How I Built This)

**`app/scrapers/youtube/__init__.py`**
- Exports: `YouTubeScraper`, `Video`, `Channel`, `CHANNELS`

**`tests/test_youtube_scraper.py`**
- `test_fetch_latest_video_returns_video` — hits real RSS feed for 2 channels, validates Video fields
- `test_fetch_transcript_attaches_text` — fetches transcript for Fireship's latest video

**Infrastructure**
- `docker-compose.yml` — Postgres 16 + app container
- `.env.example` — `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Postgres credentials
- `pyproject.toml` — Python 3.14, deps: feedparser, youtube-transcript-api, pydantic, sqlalchemy, alembic, apscheduler, httpx, openai, beautifulsoup4, psycopg2-binary

### What works
- YouTube RSS scraping — confirmed working, returns valid `Video` Pydantic models
- `test_fetch_latest_video_returns_video` — PASSED
- `test_fetch_transcript_attaches_text` — SKIPPED (IP blocked by YouTube on this machine; expected in some environments, not a code bug)

### What doesn't work / not yet built
- `app/db/` — empty, no models, migrations, or connection setup
- `app/models/` — empty
- `app/services/` — empty, no LLM/summarisation logic
- `agent/` — empty
- `app/scrapers/events/` — empty, no event scraper yet
- No scheduler wired up (APScheduler installed but unused)
- No database writes — scraper returns data but nothing persists
- No OpenAI/LLM integration
- No API layer or entrypoint

### Errors hit
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` when running tests from inside `tests/` dir — fixed by running pytest from project root
- `__init__.py` still exported old function names (`scrape_channel`, `fetch_latest_videos`, `fetch_transcript`) after refactor to class — fixed by updating exports
- `Video` was a `@dataclass` — replaced with Pydantic `BaseModel`; `fetch_transcript` updated to use `model_copy` instead of mutating in place

### What's next
1. Set up DB layer — SQLAlchemy models in `app/db/`, Alembic migrations
2. Persist scraped videos to Postgres
3. ~~Build event scraper in `app/scrapers/events/`~~ — done (see 2026-03-10 session 2)
4. Wire up APScheduler to run scrapers on a schedule
5. Add OpenAI summarisation in `app/services/`
6. Build agent logic in `agent/`

### What was built

**`app/scrapers/events/feeds.py`**
- `FEEDS` — 2 iCal feeds initially: DC Tech Events, DC Startup Hub (expanded to 25 feeds in next session)

**`app/scrapers/events/scraper.py`**
- `Event(BaseModel)` — Pydantic model: `title`, `start_time`, `end_time | None`, `location | None`, `url | None`, `source`
- `_to_utc_datetime(dt)` — helper to normalise iCal `date` or naive `datetime` to UTC-aware `datetime`
- `EventScraper` class — instantiated with optional `feeds` list + `within_days=14`
  - `_fetch_feed(url)` — `httpx.get` with redirects + 10s timeout, raises on HTTP error
  - `_parse_feed(raw, source)` — parses iCal bytes, filters to upcoming window, handles `date` vs `datetime` DTSTART/DTEND
  - `scrape()` — fetches all feeds, combines, sorts by `start_time`; bad feeds log a warning and are skipped

**`app/scrapers/events/__init__.py`**
- Exports: `EventScraper`, `Event`, `FEEDS`

**`tests/test_event_scraper.py`**
- `test_scrape_returns_events` — hits both real feeds, validates Event fields and source names
- `test_events_are_upcoming` — asserts all events fall within [now, now+14d]
- `test_events_sorted_by_start_time` — asserts sort order

**`pyproject.toml`**
- Added `icalendar>=7.0.3`

### What works
- `test_scrape_returns_events` — PASSED
- `test_events_are_upcoming` — PASSED
- `test_events_sorted_by_start_time` — PASSED
- Both feeds (DC Tech Events + DC Startup Hub) return valid `Event` models

### What doesn't work / not yet built
- `app/db/` — still empty
- `app/models/` — still empty
- `app/services/` — still empty
- `agent/` — still empty
- No scheduler, no DB writes, no LLM integration, no API layer

### Errors hit
- None this session

### What's next
1. Set up DB layer — SQLAlchemy models in `app/db/`, Alembic migrations
2. Persist scraped `Video` and `Event` objects to Postgres
3. Wire up APScheduler to run both scrapers on a schedule
4. Add OpenAI summarisation in `app/services/`
5. Build agent logic in `agent/`
6. ~~Build main.py~~ — done (see 2026-03-10 session 3)
7. ~~Filter YouTube Shorts~~ — done (see 2026-03-10 session 3)
8. ~~Deduplicate events~~ — done (see 2026-03-10 session 3)

## 2026-03-10 — Feeds expanded to 25, INTERACTIVE_WINDOW.md created

### What was built / changed

**`app/scrapers/events/feeds.py`**
- Expanded from 2 feeds to 25 feeds across DC, DMV, and Baltimore
- Added categories: AI/ML (4 groups), Data & Analytics (3), Cloud (1), Web & Mobile (2), Diversity (1), Hardware (1), Blockchain (1), Gaming (1), Baltimore (3), Networking/General (6)
- All feeds use the Meetup iCal URL pattern: `https://www.meetup.com/[slug]/events/ical/`
- Luma feeds excluded — require authentication, no public `.ics`
- PyData DC excluded — returns 403
- Maryland non-Meetup sites (TEDCO, Maryland Tech Council, etc.) excluded — no `.ics` feeds

```

**`app/scrapers/events/scraper.py`**
- Added `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; event-aggregator/1.0)` header to `_fetch_feed` — required by Tockify (was returning 403 without it)
- Added regex fix for Tockify malformed iCal: `P15M` → `PT15M` in `X-PUBLISHED-TTL` / `REFRESH-INTERVAL` fields

**`INTERACTIVE_WINDOW.md`** (new file at project root)
- Cheatsheet for using VSCode Interactive Window
- Explains `sys.path.insert` fix needed once per session
- Ready-to-paste code cells for EventScraper, single-feed scraping, YouTubeScraper, transcripts
- Notes on `HttpUrl` vs `str`, where shell commands go, kernel restart behaviour

**`app/__init__.py`, `app/scrapers/__init__.py`, `app/db/__init__.py`, `app/models/__init__.py`, `app/services/__init__.py`, `tests/__init__.py`**
- All created (empty) — required for Python package imports to resolve correctly

### What works
- All 5 tests passing
- 25 feeds returning ~100+ events in the next 14 days
- EventScraper handles per-feed failures gracefully (one bad feed doesn't break others)

### Errors hit
- Tockify 403 — fixed with `User-Agent` header
- Tockify `InvalidCalendar: Invalid iCalendar duration: P15M` — fixed with raw bytes regex before parsing
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` from missing `__init__.py` files — fixed by creating them
- Interactive window confusion: VSCode Interactive Window is Python-only; shell commands go in Terminal

### What's next
1. Set up DB layer — SQLAlchemy models in `app/db/`, Alembic migrations
2. Persist scraped `Video` and `Event` objects to Postgres
3. Wire up APScheduler to run both scrapers on a schedule
4. Add OpenAI summarisation in `app/services/`
5. Build agent logic in `agent/`

```

### What was built / changed

**`main.py`** (new file at project root)
- Runs both scrapers and prints a summary to the terminal
- `sys.path.insert(0, Path(__file__).parent)` ensures `app` resolves correctly from any working directory
- Run with: `.venv/bin/python main.py`

**`app/scrapers/youtube/scraper.py`**
- Added `_is_short(video_id)` — HEAD request to `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/{id}` with `follow_redirects=False`; returns `True` if status 200 (Short), `False` if redirect (regular video)
- `fetch_latest_videos()` now skips Shorts

**`app/scrapers/events/scraper.py`**
- `Event` model updated: `url: HttpUrl | None` → `urls: list[str] = []`, `source: str` → `sources: list[str] = []`
- Added `_deduplicate()` — groups by `(title.lower(), start_time.date())`, merges URLs + sources from duplicates
- `scrape()` calls `_deduplicate()` before sorting

**`tests/test_event_scraper.py`**
- Updated: `event.source` → `event.sources` (list)

### What works
- `main.py` runs end-to-end
- Shorts filtered from YouTube results
- Duplicate events merged into one entry with combined URLs and sources
- All tests passing

### Errors hit
- `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'channel_id'` — `CHANNELS` is dicts not objects; fixed with `ch["channel_id"]`
- `AttributeError: 'Event' object has no attribute 'urls'` in Interactive Window — stale kernel; fixed by restarting kernel
- PDF `FPDFUnicodeEncodingException` on smart quotes — fixed with Arial TTF from `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/`
- PDF date rendering off-screen — fixed by adding `new_x="LMARGIN", new_y="NEXT"` to `multi_cell`

### What's next
1. Set up DB layer — SQLAlchemy models in `app/db/`, Alembic migrations
2. Persist scraped `Video` and `Event` objects to Postgres
3. Wire up APScheduler to run both scrapers on a schedule
4. Add OpenAI summarisation in `app/services/`
5. Build agent logic in `agent/`

---

## 2026-03-10 — DB layer + project cleanup

### What was built

**PostgreSQL DB layer (complete)**
- `app/db/session.py` — SQLAlchemy engine + `SessionLocal`; reads `DATABASE_URL` from env, defaults to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/aggregator`
- `app/db/models.py` — `YouTubeVideo` (PK: `video_id`) and `Event` (composite PK: `title` + `start_time`) ORM models; uses `ARRAY(Text)` for `urls` and `sources` columns
- `app/db/repository.py` — `save_videos`, `save_events` (both use `db.merge()` for upsert safety), `get_videos`, `get_events`
- `scripts/create_tables.py` — runs `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` to initialise tables

**`infra/docker-compose.yml`** — Postgres 16 container, credentials `postgres`/`postgres`, DB `aggregator`

**Project structure cleanup**
- Created `infra/` — moved `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` here
- Created `scripts/` — moved `create_tables.py` here
- Created `docs/` — moved `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `INTERACTIVE_WINDOW.md` here
- Added `Makefile` at root with short aliases
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore`

**`Makefile` targets**
```
make up       → docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
make down     → docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml down
make db-init  → uv run scripts/create_tables.py
make run      → uv run main.py
make test     → uv run pytest
```

### What works
- `make up` starts Postgres
- `make db-init` creates `youtube_videos` and `events` tables
- Connection verified in Beekeeper Studio (localhost:5432, postgres/postgres, db: aggregator)

### What works
- `make up` starts Postgres
- `make db-init` creates `youtube_videos` and `events` tables
- Connection verified in Beekeeper Studio (localhost:5432, postgres/postgres, db: aggregator)

### What's next (superseded by next session)
1. Wire `repository.py` into `main.py` — persist scraped results to Postgres after each run
2. Wire up APScheduler to run both scrapers on a schedule
3. Add OpenAI summarisation in `app/services/`
4. Build agent logic in `agent/`

## 2026-03-10 — Transcripts + Webshare proxy + full pipeline wired up

### What was built

**`app/scrapers/youtube/scraper.py`**
- Fixed syntax bug: `except TranscriptsDisabled, NoTranscriptFound:` → `except (TranscriptsDisabled, NoTranscriptFound):`
- Added `_build_transcript_api()` — reads `WEBSHARE_PROXY_USERNAME` / `WEBSHARE_PROXY_PASSWORD` from env; if set, uses `WebshareProxyConfig`; otherwise direct requests
- `fetch_transcript()` now uses `_build_transcript_api()`

**`main.py`**
- Enabled `with_transcripts=True`
- Wired up `repository.save_videos()` and `repository.save_events()` — every run persists to Postgres

**`.env.example`** — added `WEBSHARE_PROXY_USERNAME` / `WEBSHARE_PROXY_PASSWORD` (blank by default)

### What works
- `make run` scrapes videos + events, fetches transcripts via Webshare proxy, saves everything to Postgres
- `youtube_videos.transcript` column populated in Beekeeper Studio
- Proxy is optional — leave blank in `.env` for direct requests (fine locally, may be blocked on cloud)

### What's next
1. Wire up APScheduler to run both scrapers on a schedule
2. Add OpenAI summarisation in `app/services/`
3. Build agent logic in `agent/`

---

## 2026-03-11 — Digest infrastructure + OpenAI integration

### What was built

**`app/db/models.py`** — added `Digest` table
- Composite PK: `(article_id, article_type)` — enables `db.merge()` upsert
- Fields: `url`, `title`, `summary`, `tools_concepts` (YouTube only), `relevance_score` (event only, 0–100), `source`, `created_at`
- `article_id` for events serialized as `"{title}||{start_time.isoformat()}"`

**`app/db/repository.py`** — added `digest_exists()` and `save_digest()`

**`agent/youtube_agent.py`** — YouTube digest agent
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` with `client.beta.chat.completions.parse()` (structured output)
- Returns `YouTubeDigestResult(title, summary, tools_concepts)`

**`agent/event_agent.py`** — Event digest agent
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` with `client.beta.chat.completions.parse()` (structured output)
- Returns `EventDigestResult(title, summary, relevance_score)`

**`app/services/process_digest.py`** — `process_digest(db)` orchestrator
- Reads all videos + events from DB, skips already-digested items
- Catches per-item errors without stopping the run

**`main.py`** — added `load_dotenv()` + wired `process_digest(db)` at end of pipeline

**`scripts/` and `Makefile`** — `make run` now runs the full pipeline end-to-end

### Current full pipeline (`make run`)
1. Scrape YouTube (last 2 days) → upsert to `youtube_videos`
2. Scrape Events (next 1 day) → upsert to `events`
3. Digest unprocessed videos via OpenAI → save to `digests`
4. Digest unprocessed events via OpenAI → save to `digests`

### What works
- All 3 tables (`youtube_videos`, `events`, `digests`) populated in Beekeeper Studio
- Digests contain AI-generated titles, summaries, tools/concepts, and relevance scores
- Re-runs are idempotent — already-digested items are skipped

### Errors hit
- `'GEMINI_API_KEY'` KeyError — `.env` not loaded at runtime; fixed with `load_dotenv()` in `main.py`
- Gemini free tier daily quota exhausted — switched to OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`
- `IpBlocked` from YouTube transcript API — added to except clause, transcript stored as `null`

### What's next
1. Wire up APScheduler to run the full pipeline on a schedule
2. Build API layer to serve digest data
3. Build frontend or notification output (email / Slack digest)

## 2026-03-11 — Channel ID resolver + interactive selector (shelved)

### What was built

**`scripts/get_channel_id.py`**
- Standalone CLI to resolve a YouTube channel ID from a handle, name, or full URL
- Uses `httpx` + regex on the raw page HTML (no API key needed)
- Tries 5 regex patterns: `channelId`, `externalChannelId`, `ucid`, `channel_id=`, `browseId`
- Usage: `uv run scripts/get_channel_id.py fireship` → `UC2Xd-TjJByJyK2w1zNwY0zQ`
- Direct `/channel/UCxxx` URLs return the ID immediately (no HTTP request)

**`app/scrapers/youtube/resolver.py`** (new)
- Same `get_channel_id()` logic extracted as an importable module
- Exported from `app/scrapers/youtube/__init__.py`

**`app/scrapers/youtube/selector.py`** (new, shelved for later)
- `select_channels()` — interactive CLI prompt to pick channels from the library and optionally add new ones
- Supports session-only additions or permanent save to `channels.py`
- Not wired into `main.py` yet — will be added when interactive mode is needed

### What works
- `uv run scripts/get_channel_id.py fireship` → resolves correctly
- Direct channel URLs work immediately (no HTTP needed)
- Some channels (e.g. `@theo-t3gg`) return "Not found" — YouTube doesn't embed channel ID in all page types; workaround is to use the direct `/channel/UCxxx` URL

### What's next
1. Wire up APScheduler to run the full pipeline on a schedule
2. Build API layer to serve digest data
3. Build frontend or notification output (email / Slack digest)
4. Wire `select_channels()` from `selector.py` into `main.py` when interactive channel picking is needed
